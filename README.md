# AndroPen
AndroPen is an open source project that I created as a means to meet my requirements. It allows you to transmit your touch and stylus data from your Android device to your Windows PC. This is mostly geared toward artists but likely has other uses that I have not, personally, thought of.

# Project Scope
AndroPen aims to turn your Android tablet into a screenless digitizer for your computer. AndroPen transmits touch inputs for touch and gesture directly to the Windows API through Wifi. Potentially, more communication protocols will be added to increase the versatility of the system.

Screen duplication to the android tablet is outside of the scope of this project. There are already options for casting the entire PC screen to an Android Tablet and use it as external display. This comes with two major drawbacks that I, personally, did not want. Firstly, it causes your system to reconfigure your displays to accomodate the change every time you connect or disconnect app which is inconveneint. Secondly, if you want to use those applications with screen duplication, it limits the refresh rate of both devices to whichever is the slowest which can cause a high-end monitor to be throttled down to the speed of your tablet. By not registering the tablet as an external monitor, AndroPen avoids both of these issues while allowing you to input to your PC.
